# PERN To-Do App

A basic To-Do App using PERN stack<br/>
**PERN** stands for PostgreSQL, Express.js, React & Node.js<br/>
<br/>

## How to set it up

To see how it works, simply clone this respository or a fork of this repository<br/>
and run `npm i` or `npm install` on the `client` and `server` folders.<br/>
Then you need to go to `./server/db.js` and change the **example** password<br/>
to the one you actually use in Postgres.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have done this, the last thing you need to do is go to `client` folder<br/>
and run `npm start`.<br/>
<br/>

## How to use it

It is a simple To-Do app. Just add a task in the input bar and then click<br/>
on the green **Add** button or just hit the `enter` key on your keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have added a task, you can edit or delete it by clicking the respective<br/>
**yellow** and **red** buttons.
